Vectorization Method: Sentence Embeddings

Use sentence-transformers like all-MiniLM-L6-v2 to convert each support ticket into a dense, semantic vector.

    Why: Unlike TF-IDF or Bag-of-Words, these embeddings understand context, not just keywords.

    How:

    from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
    model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
    embeddings = model.encode(list_of_texts)

üîç Clustering Algorithm: BERTopic (Built on HDBSCAN + Embeddings)

    Why it's the best:

        Combines sentence embeddings with HDBSCAN, a density-based clustering method.

        Automatically discovers the number of topics.

        Extracts interpretable keywords for each cluster.

    Bonus: Visualizations like bar charts and topic hierarchies.

    How it works:

        Generate sentence embeddings for each ticket.

        Use HDBSCAN to cluster them.

        Use class-based TF-IDF to extract top words for each cluster.
